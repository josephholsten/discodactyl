= Discodactyl is going away

Discodacyl has had a good run, but everyone would be better served with a single awesome ruby webfinger client.

So today I'm deprecating discodactyl in favor of [redfinger](https://github.com/intridea/redfinger). It's lacking a few things, but I hope to get those added soon.

So long, and thanks for all the salmon!
